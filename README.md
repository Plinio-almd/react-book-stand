# React Book Stand

React Book Stand is a simple web application built with React.js that allows users to browse a collection of books. Users can view details about each book, such as the title, author, quantity of each book available, and description.
I started building it to keep practicing, to try different libraries and learn to make my own stuff.
There is the backend for this app that I'm still working on. Soon I will implement the user authentication, the API to fetch books and CRUD data in a MySql DB.
